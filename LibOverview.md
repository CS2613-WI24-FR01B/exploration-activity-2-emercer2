# Library Overview - Colorama
## 1. Which package/library did you select?
For exploration activity 2 I chose the python library [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/).

## 2. What is the package/library?
### • What purpose does it serve?
### • How do you use it?
### • This section should be the largest and go into lots of detail. Not everything here must be utilized in your sample program.
The purpose of this library is to allow windows users the same coloured output functionality as IOS. By installing the library and using the predetermined variables windows users ain access to a wide variety of colours and terminal text styles.

## 3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?
### • Snippets of code and examples of output should be given here.
This library has the capability to style text is three different ways. Style, text colour, and background colour.

## 4. When was it created?
The latest release of [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) (0.4.6) was released October 24th 2022.

## 5. Why did you select this package/library?
### • “Because it is interesting” is not a valid answer. Should elaborate more.
I chose this library because I felt it could bring extra clarity to my I/O in future and i did not already know how to colour test through python programs. 

## 6. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?
While experiement I got to learn about how to print literals in python even though I didnt use it in the end product.

## 7. How was your overall experience with the package/library?
### • When would you recommend this package/library to someone?
### • Would you continue using this package/library? Why or why not
I had a great experience with this library, although there were sometroubles along the way. For one my terminal in VSCode was not showing the same colours as my windows terminal, this confused at first after some research it looks like this may be due to some sort of setting in VSCode. I would definately use this library again if the oppertunity arose.
