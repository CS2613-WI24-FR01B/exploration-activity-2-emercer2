## 2. What is the package/library? **
### • What purpose does it serve?
### • How do you use it?
### • This section should be the largest and go into lots of detail. Not everything here must be utilized in your sample program.

Colorama allows Windows users easy access to variuos terminal text styles that are already present in IOS systems. Using this library text can be changed in three different ways in a clean easy to use format. The three different ways text can be changed with this library include style, text colour, and background colour. With a variety of two different functioning styles and 8 colours many text styling combinations are now possible for terminal output. <br><br>

The styles offered include:
- dim (currently non-functioning, appears as normal)
- normal
- bright<br>

## 3. What are the functionalities of the package/library? **
### • Snippets of code and examples of output should be given here.


This library has the capability to style text is three different ways. Style, text colour, and background colour.

The latest release of [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) (0.4.6) was released October 24th 2022.

## 5. Why did you select this package/library? **
### • “Because it is interesting” is not a valid answer. Should elaborate more.


I chose this library because I felt it could bring extra clarity to my I/O in future and i did not already know how to colour test through python programs. 

## 6. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language? **


While experiement I got to learn about how to print literals in python even though I didnt use it in the end product.

## 7. How was your overall experience with the package/library? **
### • When would you recommend this package/library to someone?
### • Would you continue using this package/library? Why or why not


I had a great experience with this library, although there were sometroubles along the way. For one my terminal in VSCode was not showing the same colours as my windows terminal, this confused at first after some research it looks like this may be due to some sort of setting in VSCode. I would definately use this library again if the oppertunity arose.
